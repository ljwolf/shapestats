    Using equation listed on en.wikipedia.org/Second_Moment_of_area, the second
    moment of area is actually the cross-moment of area between the X and Y
    dimensions:

    I_xy = (1/24)\sum^{i=N}^{i=1} (x_iy_{i+1} + 2*x_iy_i + 2*x_iy_{i+1} +
    x_{i+1}y_i)(x_iy_i - x_{i+1}y_i)

    where x_i, y_i is the current point and x_{i+1}, y_{i+1} is the next point,
    and where x_{n+1} = x_1, y_{n+1} = 1.

    This relation is known as the:
    - second moment of area
    - moment of inertia of plane area
    - area moment of inertia
    - second area moment

    and is *not* the mass moment of inertia, a property of the distribution of
    mass around a shape.
