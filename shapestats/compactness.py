def ipq(poly):
    r"""
    The Isoperimetric quotient, defined as the ratio of a poly's area to the
    area of the equi-perimeter circle.

    Altman's PA_1 measure

    Construction:
    --------------
    let:
    p_d = perimeter of district
    a_d = area of district

    a_c = area of the constructed circle
    r = radius of constructed circle

    then the relationship between the constructed radius and the district
    perimeter is:
    p_d = 2 \pi r
    p_d / (2 \pi) = r

    meaning the area of the circle can be expressed as:
    a_c = \pi r^2
    a_c = \pi (p_d / (2\pi))^2

    implying finally that the IPQ is:

    pp = (a_d) / (a_c) = (a_d) / ((p_d / (2*\pi))^2 * \pi) = (a_d) / (p_d**2 / (4\PI))
